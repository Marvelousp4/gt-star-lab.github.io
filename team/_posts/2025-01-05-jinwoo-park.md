My name is Jinwoo Park, and I received a Ph.D. in Robotics from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was advised by Dr. Seth Hutchinson. I was also an honorary member of the STAR Lab at Georgia Tech, directed by Dr. Harish Ravichandar.
My research focuses on heterogeneous multi-robot systems, with particular interests in task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. I am especially motivated by problems that bridge rigorous optimization with real-world robotic execution.
I received an M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, an M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University, and a B.S.E. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan.
